> ðŸš« **DEPRECATED â€” No Longer Using Script-Based Tmux Management**
>
> **This plugin is no longer maintained.**
> I no longer use this Zsh plugin to manage [Oh My Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) or any script-based tooling for `tmux` configuration.
> Instead, I now configure `tmux` declaratively using [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) as part of my Nix-based dotfiles.
>
> ðŸ‘‰ My current `tmux` configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/Hzbeta/nix-dotfiles/blob/main/modules/tmux.nix).

  Further, you can use the following config to:

  zinit load Hzbeta/omt-manager
  ```

- **Oh My Zsh**

  1. Clone the repository into the `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` directory:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Hzbeta/omt-manager.git "${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/omt-manager"
  ```

  2. Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your `.zshrc`:

  antigen bundle Hzbeta/omt-manager

<!-- Supplement other bash plugin managers if needed -->

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hzbeta/omt-manager.git
   ```

2. Add the following line to your `.zshrc` (for Zsh) or `.bashrc` (for Bash), replacing `/path/to/omt-manager.sh` with the actual path to the `omt-manager.sh` file in the cloned repository:

   ```sh
   source /path/to/omt-manager/omt-manager.sh
   ```

## Custom Configuration

The default installation and configuration paths for Oh My Tmux and Tmux are as follows:

```sh
# Default installation path of Oh My Tmux
MANAGER_OMT_DIR_PATH="${HOME}/.tmux"

# Default configuration paths for Tmux
MANAGER_OMT_CONF_PATH="${HOME}/.tmux.conf"
MANAGER_OMT_LOCAL_CONF_PATH="${HOME}/.tmux.conf.local"
```

You can Customize the installation path of *Oh My Tmux* and the configuration path of Tmux by setting the following environment variables:

```sh
# Customize the installation path of Oh My Tmux
export MANAGER_OMT_DIR_PATH="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/oh-my-tmux"

# Customize the configuration path of Tmux
export MANAGER_OMT_CONF_PATH="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf"
export MANAGER_OMT_LOCAL_CONF_PATH="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf.local"
```

**Be cautious** when configuring these paths, as this plugin works within the directory of Oh my tmux. If you set the folder path of another Git project as the path for Oh my tmux, that project may become **corrupted**. Therefore, please **double-check your configuration** before running any commands related to this plugin.

## Development

To develop this plugin, you need to install the following dependencies:
- [act](https://github.com/nektos/act): A tool for running GitHub Actions locally.
- [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2): A unit test framework for Bash.
- [bashcov](https://github.com/infertux/bashcov): A code coverage analysis tool for Bash.

And then, you can run the following commands to start developing:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the repository in your favorite editor.
3. Make changes to the code.
4. Run `bash ./tests/coverage_report.sh` to test your changes and generate a coverage report, please make sure that the coverage is 100%.
5. Run `act` to test your changes with GitHub Actions locally.
6. Push your changes to GitHub and create a Pull Request.

Tips:
- If you are using VS Code, you can use the Dev Container to develop this plugin without installing any dependencies. See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for more details.
- And if you are using WSL2 and Docker Desktop, please run `docker login` in WSL2, before opening Dev Container to avoid the `credsStore` error.
- The default Dockerfile does not contain the `act` tool, as `act` utilizes Docker itself. If you want to use `act` within the Dev Container, you will need to configure Docker in Docker (DinD) or Docker out of Docker (DooD) manually.
